# QuickSort Students

This is a Java program that allows the user to create a list of students and their names, addresses, and GPAs. Once the user has entered the students, the students are sorted alphabetically, by name. The results are then output to a text file.

Notes:
* The accepted values for the GPA are based on a 4.0 scale
* The FileOutputStream location must be changed to be implemented on a new system
